//What is Node js?
// Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser—typically on a server.

// Here's a breakdown:
// ✅ What it is:
// Built on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine that powers Chrome).

// Lets you use JavaScript on the server side, not just in the browser.

// Known for being fast, lightweight, and efficient, especially with I/O-heavy tasks.



// 🛠️ What you can do with Node.js:
// Build web servers and APIs

// Create real-time apps (like chat apps) with WebSockets

// Work with filesystems, databases, and more

// Build CLI tools

// Handle background jobs, automation, and scripting





// ⚡ Key Features:
// Feature	Description
// Non-blocking I/O	Handles many connections at once without waiting on one task to finish.
// Event-driven	Uses events and callbacks, which is great for scalability.
// Single-threaded	Uses one thread, but can handle thousands of connections using asynchronous code.
// NPM (Node Package Manager)	Comes with Node and gives access to over 1 million open-source packages.



// Basic HTTP server in Node.js
// const http = require('http');

// const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
//   res.end('Hello from Node.js!');
// });

// server.listen(3000, () => {
//   console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
// });
