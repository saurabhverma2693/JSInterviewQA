Diff between testing and dubugging in web applications:


# Yes, there is a significant difference between testing and debugging 
in web applications: testing aims to identify defects, 
while debugging focuses on finding and fixing those defects.
 Testing is about verifying functionality, performance, and reliability, 
 while debugging involves the process of
 locating and resolving issues once they've been found.


# Key Differences:
Purpose:
Testing seeks to find bugs, errors,
 and vulnerabilities to ensure the web application meets its requirements. 
 Debugging's purpose is to pinpoint the exact cause of these identified issues and eliminate them. 

 Process:
Testing can be manual or automated and involves various types like 
unit, integration, and performance testing. Debugging, on the other hand,
 typically involves analyzing code, using tools like logging and tracing,
  and modifying the source code to correct errors. 
Who performs it:
Testers are primarily responsible for performing tests, 
while developers and programmers are typically responsible for debugging. 

Timing:
Debugging occurs after testing has identified a defect.
 Testing can occur throughout the development lifecycle,
 including before and after debugging sessions.
